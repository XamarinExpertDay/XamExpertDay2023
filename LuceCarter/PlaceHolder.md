# Zero to Mobile Database Hero - Online/Offline data cabapble apps with MongoDB Atlas, Realm and MAUI

Storage of data is a core part of many applications. Historically, when you ask developers about databases, they will talk to you about SQLite. But this is not the only way! In this session, Luce will introduce you to the powerful Developer Data Platform of MongoDB and how their cloud-hosted products, including Realm can allow you to easily store, query and manipulate data, with automatic online/offline sync, authentication and more. You will go away feeling more confident to turn your back on SQL and embrace the power of the document data model!
